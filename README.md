# PUBLICS
This project is a part of my Master Studies' course. It is a Horizon 2020 proposal and presentation. PUBLICS means Provide Uniform Basic Literacy in Informational and Computing Sector .
The main purpose of this project is to provide basic uniform computer literacy for as many people as possible on territory of Republic of Serbia by 2020, with emphasis on those born before year 1980. We want to help in resolving the enormous issue of generational gap between people born before and after 1980.
